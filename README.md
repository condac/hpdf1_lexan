# THIS CAR IS NEVER TESTED ON TRACK!!! (yet..)

Still very much work in progress. Will test it soon.

# HPD F1 Lexan version
Custom version of the HPD F1 to use lexan body. 

## About
This is my custom version of the HPD F1 by Kent Asplund. It still uses the rear parts and wings from his project. Join discussion on Google+ https://plus.google.com/communities/117625327650679845498 

## Material
This version is focused to be printed in Nylon 910 Alloy. The material is soft and I will try to make it as rigid as possible with the material properties that the nylon has. The 910 Alloy is stiff for a nylon material but still very hard to break. 

There should be no problem printing it with PLA or other material, but it might break more easy.
